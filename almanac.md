The **Almanac** is a regenerating digital aggregation of information managed by CLIR for the Committee on Coherence at Scale. The Almanac will include articles, blogs, links, original research studies conducted by the Committee and published by CLIR, statistics, maps, data, funding strategies, and the [Digital Library Federation](https://www.diglib.org) publication series FactSheets. As the work generated by the Committee comes to fruition, it will be included in the Almanac.

## Contents

FactSheets is a CLIR/DLF publication series of one page profiles on large-scale, multi-partner initiatives happening across the library and IT communities in higher education.
